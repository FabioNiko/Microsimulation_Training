Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[USA Tax-Calculator Contributor
Guide](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tax-calculator-contributor-guide)
on how to clone the pitaxcalc-demo git repository.  Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the Contributor Guide and
then read about our [coding
style](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/Tax_Microsimulation/blob/master/CODING.md#coding-style)
and [testing
procedures](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/Tax_Microsimulation/blob/master/TESTING.md#testing-procedures).
You may find this [git cheat
sheet](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/Tax_Microsimulation/blob/master/SIMPLE_GIT_USAGE.md#simple-git-usage)
useful in preparing a GitHub pull request that contains your proposed
code changes.  The step-by-step workflow used to create and modify a
new pull request has been documented for the USA Tax-Calculator in this
[workflow document](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/WORKFLOW.md#tax-calculator-pull-request-workflow).

The pitaxcalc-demo [release
history](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/Tax_Microsimulation/blob/master/RELEASES.md#pitaxcalc-demo-release-history)
provides a summary of past development work.
